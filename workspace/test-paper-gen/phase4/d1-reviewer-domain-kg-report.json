The choice of ALCHIQ description logic is well-justified and the modular ontology design follows best practices. The domain-specific nature of the ontology provides clear value over generic industrial KGs. The main areas for improvement are: (1) providing concrete ontology code examples for verification, (2) formalizing the LCWA/OWA hybrid approach, (3) demonstrating SHACL validation, and (4) evaluating ontology completeness. With these additions, the KG/ontology contribution would be substantially stronger. The neuro-symbolic integration approach is sound and the hybrid reasoning framework is well-designed. The paper is ready for acceptance with minor revisions addressing ontology engineering specifics."
