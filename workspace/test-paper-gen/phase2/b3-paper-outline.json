    "abstract_draft": "Intelligent fault diagnosis in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems faces critical challenges: low efficiency in knowledge organization, lack of adaptability between static knowledge frameworks and dynamic engineering environments, and difficulty integrating expert knowledge with real-time data streams. This paper proposes a novel intelligent CNC fault diagnosis system that synergizes Large Language Models (LLMs) with domain Knowledge Graphs (KGs) through a bidirectional reasoning mechanism. Our system features a four-layer architecture comprising perception, knowledge, reasoning, and application layers. We develop a domain-specific KG construction method for CNC fault diagnosis using ALCHIQ description logic, enabling structured representation of fault patterns, diagnostic methods, and maintenance knowledge. The bidirectional reasoning mechanism leverages KGs to validate LLM outputs through semantic matching and subgraph retrieval, while LLMs enhance KG reasoning through knowledge extraction and completion. We also design a multi-modal information fusion approach integrating sensor data, equipment logs, and maintenance documents. Experimental evaluation on a dataset of 1,000 fault instances demonstrates significant improvements over baseline systems, with ablation studies validating the contribution of each component. This work provides a neuro-symbolic framework for explainable AI in intelligent manufacturing, addressing the hallucination problem in LLMs while enhancing the reasoning capabilities of knowledge graphs.",
    "narrative_arc": {
      "problem": "CNC fault diagnosis systems suffer from fragmented knowledge organization, static knowledge frameworks that cannot adapt to dynamic engineering environments, and the challenge of integrating tacit expert knowledge with real-time equipment data streams. Existing approaches either rely on rule-based systems with limited expressiveness, pure deep learning methods lacking explainability, or single-technology solutions that cannot handle the complexity of modern manufacturing environments.",
      "insight": "The key breakthrough is a bidirectional reasoning mechanism where knowledge graphs and large language models mutually enhance each other: KGs provide factual grounding and semantic constraints for LLMs to reduce hallucinations, while LLMs extract and generate structured knowledge to expand KG coverage and reasoning capabilities. This creates a self-reinforcing knowledge ecosystem that combines the strengths of symbolic reasoning and neural understanding.",
      "solution": "A four-layer hierarchical architecture: (1) Perception layer collects multi-modal data from sensors, logs, and documents; (2) Knowledge layer houses the CNC-specific knowledge graph with ALCHIQ-based ontology; (3) Reasoning layer implements bidirectional LLM-KG reasoning with hybrid symbolic-neural inference; (4) Application layer provides fault diagnosis, explanation generation, and decision support. The knowledge graph serves as a semantic hub, providing unified representation and coordination across all components.",
      "validation": "Comprehensive evaluation using 1,000 annotated fault instances across common, complex, rare, and noisy categories. Four baseline systems (rule-based, LLM-only, KG-only, unidirectional KG-augmented) tested on accuracy, precision, recall, F1, response time, KG reasoning accuracy, and hallucination rate. Four ablation studies validate each component's contribution. Real-world deployment testing confirms practical viability."

    "connecting_narrative": "Modern manufacturing relies heavily on Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems, where equipment failures can cause costly downtime and production delays. Despite advances in intelligent fault diagnosis, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: rule-based systems lack flexibility for complex故障, pure deep learning methods operate as black boxes without explainability, and single-technology solutions cannot handle the multi-modal nature of diagnostic information. Even more critically, these approaches suffer from fragmented knowledge organization—expert knowledge exists in manuals and technician experience, equipment data streams in real-time, and maintenance records in scattered databases.\n\nThe key insight that addresses these challenges is a bidirectional reasoning mechanism where Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs mutually enhance each other. LLMs excel at understanding unstructured text and generating natural language explanations, but suffer from hallucinations in specialized domains. Knowledge Graphs provide structured, factual representations of domain knowledge but cannot handle natural language inputs or learn from unstructured data. By creating a feedback loop where KGs validate and constrain LLM outputs while LLMs extract and enrich KG content, we create a self-reinforcing knowledge ecosystem that combines neural flexibility with symbolic reliability.\n\nThis insight manifests in our four-layer system architecture. The Perception Layer aggregates multi-modal data from sensors, logs, and maintenance documents. The Knowledge Layer houses a CNC-specific knowledge graph built with ALCHIQ description logic, providing a formal ontology for fault types, diagnostic methods, and system components. The Reasoning Layer implements the bidirectional LLM-KG mechanism with hybrid symbolic-neural inference. Finally, the Application Layer delivers fault diagnosis, explanation generation, and decision support services through natural language interfaces.\n\nThe architectural choices are deliberate: separating knowledge as its own layer emphasizes the semantic hub role of the KG, enabling ontology-driven coordination across components. The ALCHIQ DL framework balances expressiveness for complex fault relationships with computational tractability. Multi-modal fusion in the perception layer ensures robustness when any single data source is incomplete. Together, these design decisions create a system that is more than the sum of its parts.\n\nAdditional innovations strengthen the core approach. The modular ontology design supports independent evolution of knowledge modules. The hybrid reasoning framework delegates tasks to symbolic or neural methods based on query characteristics, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Real-time processing capabilities enable deployment in production environments where rapid故障 response is critical.\n\nTo validate these claims, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a dataset of 1,000 annotated fault instances across common, complex, rare, and noisy categories. We compare against four baselines covering the spectrum of existing approaches: traditional rule-based systems, LLM-only methods, KG-only systems, and unidirectional knowledge augmentation. Ablation studies isolate the contribution of each component. Theoretical validation connects our empirical results to the formal properties of the ALCHIQ framework and hybrid reasoning approach.\n\nThrough this work, we advance both the theory and practice of neuro-symbolic AI in intelligent manufacturing. The bidirectional reasoning framework addresses a fundamental challenge in knowledge-enhanced language models. The domain-specific knowledge graph construction methodology provides a template for other specialized domains. And the complete system demonstrates how cutting-edge AI can be deployed to solve real industrial problems with explainable, reliable results."
