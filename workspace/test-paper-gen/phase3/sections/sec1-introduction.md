## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Problem Statement

Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems are critical components in modern manufacturing environments, enabling precision machining and automated production processes. The reliability and efficiency of these systems directly impact productivity, product quality, and operational costs. When CNC equipment experiences faults, rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential to minimize downtime and prevent cascading failures across production lines. However, fault diagnosis in CNC systems presents significant technical challenges due to the complexity of modern machining equipment, the diversity of potential failure modes, and the specialized knowledge required for effective troubleshooting [Zhang2023].

Existing approaches to intelligent fault diagnosis face fundamental limitations that constrain their effectiveness in real-world manufacturing settings. Traditional rule-based systems, while providing explainable reasoning, lack the flexibility to handle novel fault patterns that fall outside predefined expert rules. Pure deep learning approaches, demonstrated by recent advances in neural network architectures for fault classification, achieve high accuracy but operate as black boxes that cannot provide the explanations required for maintenance decision-making [Li2022]. Furthermore, knowledge-based systems relying on static knowledge frameworks struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of manufacturing environments, where new equipment models and fault variants continuously emerge.

A critical challenge exacerbating these limitations is the inefficient organization of diagnostic knowledge. Expert knowledge exists in fragmented forms: technical manuals, maintenance records, technician notes, and equipment sensor data streams. Current systems fail to integrate these heterogeneous knowledge sources effectively, leading to diagnostic processes that cannot leverage the full spectrum of available information [Wang2021]. There is a clear need for intelligent fault diagnosis systems that can handle multi-modal information—combining structured sensor data, semi-structured logs, and unstructured technical documents—while providing explainable results that maintenance personnel can trust.

### 1.2 Key Insight

The key insight motivating our approach is that the limitations of existing systems can be addressed through a bidirectional reasoning mechanism where Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) mutually enhance each other's capabilities. LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, yet they suffer from hallucination problems when applied to specialized domains like CNC fault diagnosis [Zhao2024]. Knowledge Graphs provide structured, factual representations of domain knowledge but cannot handle natural language inputs or learn from unstructured text sources effectively.

By creating a feedback loop where KGs validate and constrain LLM outputs while LLMs extract and enrich KG content, we establish a self-reinforcing knowledge ecosystem that combines neural flexibility with symbolic reliability. In our proposed system, the knowledge graph serves as a semantic anchor, reducing LLM hallucinations through fact-checking and semantic consistency validation. Simultaneously, the LLM enhances the KG's reasoning capabilities by extracting structured knowledge from unstructured maintenance documents and identifying gaps in the existing ontology [Chen2023]. This bidirectional integration represents a departure from existing unidirectional approaches that use knowledge graphs solely as static retrieval sources.

The neuro-symbolic architecture enabled by this integration addresses both the explainability requirements of industrial applications and the adaptability needed for dynamic manufacturing environments. The symbolic reasoning component provides traceable logic paths that maintenance personnel can verify, while the neural component handles the semantic complexity of natural language fault descriptions and the nuances of real-world diagnostic scenarios.

### 1.3 Contributions

This paper makes four primary contributions to the field of intelligent fault diagnosis:

**Contribution 1: CNC Fault Diagnosis Domain Knowledge Graph Construction.** We present a methodology for constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs tailored to CNC equipment fault diagnosis. Our approach employs the ALCHIQ description logic framework, which provides sufficient expressiveness to capture complex fault hierarchies, component relationships, and diagnostic procedure dependencies while maintaining computational tractability. The modular ontology design separates knowledge concerning fault types, diagnostic methods, and system components, enabling independent maintenance and extension of each knowledge module [Wu2023].

**Contribution 2: Bidirectional LLM-KG Reasoning Mechanism.** We implement a bidirectional reasoning mechanism that establishes a feedback loop between neural and symbolic reasoning components. The knowledge graph constrains LLM outputs through semantic matching and subgraph retrieval, significantly reducing hallucination rates in diagnostic reports. Conversely, the LLM enhances the knowledge graph by extracting entities and relationships from unstructured maintenance documents and proposing new knowledge patterns for expert validation. This bidirectional integration contrasts with prior unidirectional approaches that treat knowledge graphs as static resources.

**Contribution 3: Multi-Modal Information Fusion for Fault Diagnosis.** We develop a comprehensive approach to integrating multi-modal information sources, including time-series sensor data, structured equipment logs, and unstructured maintenance documentation. Our fusion architecture operates at data, feature, and decision levels, enabling robust diagnosis even when individual data sources are incomplete or noisy [Feng2024]. This capability is critical for real-world deployment where diagnostic information arrives through diverse channels and formats.

**Contribution 4: Four-Layer Hierarchical System Architecture.** We design a hierarchical architecture comprising perception, knowledge, reasoning, and application layers. The explicit separation of the knowledge layer as a distinct architectural component emphasizes the central role of structured knowledge in coordinating system components. This design enables semantic interoperability between layers through ontology-driven interfaces while maintaining modularity for independent component evolution.
