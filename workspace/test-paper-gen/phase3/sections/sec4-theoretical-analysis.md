## 4. Theoretical Analysis

### 4.1 Expressiveness and Tractability

The formal foundation of our domain knowledge graph is the ALCHIQ description logic, which provides a carefully balanced trade-off between expressiveness and computational tractability for CNC fault diagnosis. ALCHIQ extends the basic ALC logic with several constructors that enable precise modeling of complex fault relationships and diagnostic procedures.

**ALCHIQ Formalization:** Our ontology employs the following constructors beyond basic ALC: (C) Complement—enowers negation and class complements; (R) Role restrictions—enables cardinality constraints on properties; (H) Role hierarchy —— allows property hierarchies with inheritance; (I) Inverse roles—declares inverse relationships for bidirectional navigation; (Q) Qualified number restrictions—enables "at least," "at most," and "exactly" constraints. This set of constructors enables representation of constraints essential to CNC fault diagnosis, such as "a spindle fault affects at most three components" or "a diagnostic procedure requires exactly one test equipment."

**Expressiveness Requirements:** CNC fault diagnosis demands several modeling capabilities that ALCHIQ provides. Class hierarchies with multiple inheritance capture the taxonomy of fault types (e.g., MechanicalFault ⊑ BearingWear). Role restrictions express domain constraints such as "every fault must have at least one symptom" (∃hasSymptom.Min 1). Qualified number restrictions model cardinality in component relationships (e.g., Assembly ⊑ ∃hasComponent.Exactly 4). Inverse properties enable bidirectional navigation between components and faults (hasFault ⊑ isAffectedBy ⊑ affectsComponent).

**Computational Complexity:** Description logics vary in reasoning complexity, with ALC being EXPTIME-complete for subsumption and instance reasoning. The addition of role restrictions (ALCH) increases complexity but remains within EXPTIME bounds for standard reasoning tasks. Practical reasoning tasks in our system—classification of fault instances, consistency checking of diagnostic rules, and query answering—complete within seconds for the scale of our knowledge base (thousands of instances). This tractability enables real-time diagnostic performance while maintaining the expressive power required for accurate fault diagnosis.

**OWL 2 DL Profile Alignment:** Our ALCHIQ-based ontology maps directly to the OWL 2 DL profile, which is a W3C standard for ontology representation on the Semantic Web. This alignment enables our system to leverage existing reasoning engines, validator tools, and ontology development environments. The OWL 2 standard ensures interoperability with industrial knowledge graph initiatives and enables future integration with broader semantic infrastructure.

### 4.2 Hybrid Reasoning Framework

Our system implements a hybrid reasoning architecture that combines symbolic reasoning methods with neural approaches, selecting the appropriate method based on query characteristics and resource constraints. Figure 7 illustrates the dual reasoning stacks and the task routing mechanism that orchestrates them.

**Symbolic Reasoning Stack:** The symbolic component provides logically guaranteed inference based on formal ontology axioms and rules. This stack operates through three primary mechanisms: (1) OWL/DL classification using description logic reasoners to determine fault type hierarchies and compute subclass relationships; (2) SWRL rules that encode diagnostic heuristics such as "if vibration frequency exceeds threshold and temperature is elevated, then suspect bearing wear"; (3) SHACL validation that ensures knowledge base consistency and enforces integrity constraints on property values and cardinalities. Symbolic reasoning is used for queries requiring deterministic answers, explicit justification paths, and validation against formal constraints.

**Neural Reasoning Stack:** The neural component provides scalable pattern recognition and generalization capabilities that complement symbolic reasoning. We employ RotatE embeddings for knowledge graph link prediction, which captures relational patterns through rotational transformations in embedding space. This enables the system to suggest potential relationships not explicitly stated in the ontology (e.g., identifying that a new component type is susceptible to similar faults as existing types). For complex fault propagation prediction, we use Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN) that aggregate neighborhood information to predict which components are likely affected given an observed fault. These neural methods excel at handling incomplete information and generalizing from limited examples.

**Task Routing Strategy:** A critical component of our hybrid approach is the task router that determines which reasoning method to employ for each diagnostic query. The router analyzes query characteristics including: (1) Structured vs. natural language input—symbolic methods handle structured queries while neural methods process text; (2) Requirement for explanation vs. pure classification—symbolic reasoning generates traceable inference chains; (3) Novelty of the fault—known faults access symbolic knowledge base, novel faults leverage neural generalization; (4) Time constraints—symbolic reasoning provides predictable latency for time-critical situations.

**Kautz Hierarchy Positioning:** Our system can be characterized as operating at Kautz Hierarchy Level 4 for knowledge-intensive reasoning. Kautz et al. define a hierarchy of reasoning capabilities: Level 1 (data-driven), Level 2 (information retrieval), Level 3 (knowledge consistency), and Level 4 (full knowledge-intensive reasoning). Our system achieves Level 4 through the combination of rich domain knowledge, formal ontological representation, and reasoning that leverages both symbolic and neural methods. This level enables comprehensive diagnostic capabilities including explanation generation, knowledge base updates, and handling of novel fault scenarios.

**Scalability Mechanisms:** To maintain performance as the knowledge base grows, our system employs several scalability strategies. Precomputation caches classification results for common fault types and materializes inference chains for frequently used diagnostic procedures. On-demand reasoning handles novel situations that cannot be answered from cached results. The neural embedding model is trained once and then serves inference requests without retraining, enabling fast link prediction. This combination of precomputation and on-demand reasoning ensures consistent response times even as the knowledge base scales to tens of thousands of fault instances.

### 4.3 Neuro-Symbolic Integration Properties

The bidirectional integration between LLM and KG creates a unique neuro-symbolic system with distinct properties regarding trust boundaries, validation mechanisms, and feedback loop convergence.

**Bidirectional Integration Type:** Our system implements what can be characterized as strong neuro-symbolic integration, where neither neural nor symbolic components are subordinate. Information flows bidirectionally: the knowledge graph validates and constrains LLM outputs, while the LLM extracts and proposes new knowledge for graph inclusion. This contrasts with weak integration approaches where neural components merely provide embedding representations or symbolic components serve only as retrieval sources. The bidirectional flow creates a virtuous cycle where knowledge quality and diagnostic accuracy mutually reinforce each other.

**Trust Boundary and Validation Mechanisms:** A critical challenge in neuro-symbolic systems is determining when to trust neural outputs versus symbolic knowledge. Our system establishes trust boundaries based on knowledge source reliability and validation status. Information from the knowledge graph (explicitly encoded by domain experts) is treated as highly trusted. LLM outputs are trusted only after semantic validation against the knowledge graph and consistency checking. Knowledge proposed by the LLM undergoes expert review before integration, creating a staged trust process where confidence increases with validation.

**Local Closed World Assumption:** Our system applies the Local Closed World Assumption (LCWA) for core knowledge while maintaining Open World Assumption (OWA) for extensions. Core fault types, diagnostic procedures, and component relationships authored by domain experts operate under LCWA—information not explicitly stated as false is assumed true. However, the system maintains OWA for knowledge extracted from maintenance documents and proposed by the LLM, enabling graceful assimilation of new knowledge without requiring complete world axiomatization. This hybrid approach provides stability for core domain knowledge while enabling growth at the periphery.

**Feedback Loop Convergence:** The bidirectional interaction creates a feedback loop that theoretically converges toward higher quality knowledge and diagnostic accuracy. While formal convergence proofs for neuro-symbolic systems remain an open research question, empirical results demonstrate that iterative refinement reduces both LLM hallucination rates and knowledge graph coverage gaps. The convergence mechanism operates through two pathways: (1) hallucination reduction—KG validation of LLM outputs decreases false diagnostic suggestions over time, and (2) knowledge completion—LLM-extracted patterns fill ontology gaps, enabling the KG to validate a broader range of LLM outputs. The system monitors both hallucination rates and ontology completeness as metrics of convergence progress.

This neuro-symbolic architecture provides both the explanatory power of symbolic reasoning and the adaptive learning capabilities of neural approaches. The formal properties outlined in this section provide the theoretical foundation for the experimental evaluation presented next, demonstrating how the design choices translate to measurable improvements in fault diagnosis accuracy, explainability, and system robustness.
