## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Summary

This paper presented a comprehensive intelligent fault diagnosis system for CNC equipment that achieves tight integration of Large Language Models and domain Knowledge Graphs through a novel bidirectional reasoning mechanism. Our four-layer architecture—comprising perception, knowledge, reasoning, and application layers—addresses the critical limitations of existing approaches: rule-based systems' inflexibility, pure deep learning's lack of explainability, and unidirectional LLM-KG integration's limited knowledge utilization.

We made four primary contributions to the field of intelligent fault diagnosis:

**First**, we developed a methodology for constructing domain-specific knowledge graphs for CNC fault diagnosis using the ALCHIQ description logic framework. Our modular ontology design separates concerns into fault type, diagnostic method, and system component modules, enabling independent maintenance and extension. The formal representation captures complex fault hierarchies, component interdependencies, and procedural knowledge required for accurate diagnosis. Experimental validation demonstrated that this domain-specific approach significantly outperforms generic industrial knowledge graphs, particularly for rare and complex fault types.

**Second**, we implemented a bidirectional LLM-KG reasoning mechanism that establishes a self-reinforcing feedback loop between neural and symbolic components. The knowledge graph validates and constrains LLM outputs through semantic matching and subgraph retrieval, reducing hallucination rates by 82.9% compared to unidirectional approaches. Conversely, the LLM enhances the knowledge graph by extracting entities and relationships from unstructured maintenance documents and proposing new patterns for expert validation. This bidirectional integration represents a fundamental advance over prior one-sided knowledge augmentation techniques.

**Third**, we designed a multi-modal information fusion approach integrating sensor data, equipment logs, and maintenance documents at data, feature, and decision levels. This architecture provides robustness when individual data sources are incomplete or unreliable—a critical capability for real-world deployment where diagnostic information arrives through diverse channels and formats. The ablation studies confirmed that multi-modal fusion contributes 7.6% accuracy improvement, with particularly strong benefits for noisy fault cases.

**Fourth**, we introduced a hierarchical system architecture with an explicit knowledge layer that serves as a semantic hub for coordinating heterogeneous components. This design achieves separation of concerns while maintaining semantic interoperability through ontology-driven interfaces. The architecture supports real-time performance (median 1.8 second response time) while providing explainable diagnostic results that maintenance personnel can trust.

Comprehensive experimental evaluation on a dataset of 1,000 fault instances validated our approach. Our system achieved 92.8% accuracy with 3.2% hallucination rate, significantly outperforming all baseline systems across key metrics. Ablation studies confirmed that each component provides substantial value, with bidirectional reasoning removal causing the largest single-component performance decline. Case studies illustrated how our system handles diverse diagnostic scenarios—common faults with clear symptoms, complex multi-component failures, and rare faults with incomplete information—through coordinated LLM and KG reasoning.

### 7.2 Future Work

Several promising directions emerge from our research and suggest pathways for continued advancement.

**Automated Knowledge Graph Construction and Maintenance:** Our current system requires expert review for LLM-proposed knowledge additions and manual ontology updates for new equipment models. Future work should develop more sophisticated validation mechanisms leveraging consistency checking, statistical outlier detection, and classifier-based confidence estimation to automate knowledge acceptance. Active learning approaches that continuously refine the ontology based on diagnostic outcomes could reduce manual maintenance overhead and enable more rapid adaptation to new equipment.

**Integration with Predictive Maintenance Systems:** While our system focuses on reactive fault diagnosis, the knowledge graph and LLM components provide foundation for predictive capabilities. Future research should develop temporal models that predict remaining useful life and failure probability based on historical patterns, sensor trends, and maintenance records. The bidirectional reasoning mechanism could support both predictive recommendations and retrospective diagnosis, enabling closed-loop maintenance optimization that addresses problems before they cause equipment failure.

**Extension to Multi-Agent Collaborative Diagnosis:** Complex manufacturing environments involve multiple CNC machines, distributed expertise, and collaborative maintenance teams. Extending our architecture to support multi-agent scenarios—where multiple diagnostic agents collaborate, share knowledge, and coordinate actions—would enhance organizational diagnostic capabilities. The knowledge graph could serve as a shared semantic repository enabling agents to build on each other's conclusions while maintaining consistency.

**Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Knowledge Sharing:** Organizations may be reluctant to share proprietary diagnostic knowledge or equipment data due to competitive concerns. Federated learning approaches could enable collaborative model training across organizations without exposing raw data or knowledge bases. Our modular ontology design and bidirectional reasoning framework provide natural foundation for federated approaches, where local knowledge graphs and LLM instances are coordinated to learn from distributed data while preserving privacy and competitive advantages.

**Model Optimization for Edge Deployment:** Industrial environments often have limited connectivity and computational resources at machine sites. Future work should explore model compression, quantization, and distillation techniques that preserve reasoning capabilities while reducing resource requirements for edge deployment. Lightweight LLM variants and knowledge graph summarization could enable accurate diagnostic capabilities on resource-constrained devices without requiring cloud connectivity.

Our research establishes a comprehensive neuro-symbolic framework for intelligent fault diagnosis that bridges the gap between explainable symbolic systems and powerful neural approaches. The bidirectional LLM-KG integration, domain-specific knowledge construction, and multi-modal fusion architecture provide a template for knowledge-enhanced AI systems in manufacturing and beyond. We believe this work opens significant research directions at the intersection of large language models, knowledge graphs, and industrial intelligence, with practical implications for improving manufacturing reliability, productivity, and safety.
