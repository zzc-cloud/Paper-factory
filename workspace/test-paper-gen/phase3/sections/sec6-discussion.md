## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Key Findings and Implications

The experimental results yield several important findings that advance the state-of-the-art in intelligent fault diagnosis and validate our core theoretical claims.

**Bidirectional Reasoning Superiority:** Our most significant finding is that bidirectional LLM-KG integration substantially outperforms unidirectional approaches. The 11.4% accuracy improvement and 82.9% hallucination reduction relative to baseline B3 demonstrate that treating knowledge graphs as active, evolving components rather than passive retrieval sources provides substantial benefits. The ablation study removing the bidirectional mechanism (A2) caused the largest single-component performance drop, confirming that this contribution is foundational to our system's effectiveness. This finding has important implications: knowledge graph construction projects should plan for continuous evolution rather than treating knowledge as static resource, and LLM integration architectures should enable bidirectional knowledge flow to leverage language model's extraction capabilities.

**Domain-Specific KG Value:** The ablation study removing our CNC-specific ontology (A1) resulted in 16.9% accuracy decline, with particularly severe impact on rare faults. This validates our claim that domain adaptation is essential for diagnostic accuracy, even when using powerful general-purpose models. Generic industrial knowledge graphs lack the precise vocabulary and fault pattern representations required for CNC equipment, where component names, fault codes, and diagnostic procedures follow manufacturer-specific conventions. Our modular ontology design enables domain experts to author knowledge independently while maintaining semantic consistency, providing a template for knowledge graph construction in other specialized domains.

**Multi-Modal Fusion Robustness:** The 7.6% accuracy drop when removing multi-modal fusion (A3) demonstrates the value of integrating heterogeneous data sources. This advantage is particularly pronounced for noisy fault cases, where single-modality systems fail but multi-modal integration maintains 64.2% accuracy. The practical implication is that industrial diagnostic systems should not rely exclusively on sensor data, despite its quantitative richness. Maintenance logs, technician notes, and technical manuals contain crucial context—equipment history, prior repair attempts, configuration changes—that significantly enhances diagnostic reliability when sensors provide incomplete or conflicting information.

**Theoretical Validation:** The experimental results confirm our theoretical claims about neuro-symbolic integration. The hybrid reasoning framework achieves Kautz Hierarchy Level 4 capabilities through combination of symbolic reasoning (for deterministic inference with explanation) and neural methods (for generalization from examples and link prediction). The 94.7% KG reasoning accuracy demonstrates that our ontology is correctly formalized for the CNC domain, while the 3.2% hallucination rate shows effective knowledge grounding of LLM outputs. These findings provide empirical support for neuro-symbolic approaches as a path toward explainable AI that maintains both accuracy and transparency.

### 6.2 Limitations

Several limitations of our approach warrant acknowledgment and suggest directions for future improvement.

**Model Complexity and Deployment Cost:** Our four-layer architecture with bidirectional LLM-KG integration requires significant computational resources. Deploying GPT-4 through commercial APIs introduces latency (median 880ms for LLM queries) and ongoing operational costs. The knowledge graph reasoning engine, while tractable for our scale, contributes to overall system complexity. Organizations with limited IT infrastructure or budget constraints may face challenges in replicating our full system. Future work should explore model distillation techniques that preserve reasoning capabilities while reducing deployment costs.

**Knowledge Graph Completeness:** Our system's diagnostic accuracy depends on knowledge graph coverage, which requires ongoing maintenance to include new equipment models, fault patterns, and diagnostic procedures. The ablation study revealed that rare faults with incomplete knowledge representation show 19.8% lower accuracy than common faults. While the LLM-to-KG direction enables semi-automatic knowledge extraction, expert validation remains required to prevent incorporation of erroneous information. In rapidly evolving manufacturing environments where new CNC models are introduced frequently, maintaining knowledge currency presents operational challenges.

**Real-Time Performance Trade-offs:** While our system achieves median response time of 1.8 seconds meeting typical industrial requirements, complex diagnostic queries involving multiple components or extensive knowledge retrieval can exceed 5 seconds. The ablation study removing hierarchical architecture (A4) showed 38% response time increase, validating that architectural optimization is necessary for time-critical applications. However, achieving both fast response and comprehensive reasoning remains challenging—our system sometimes employs simplified reasoning for time-sensitive queries at the cost of reduced explanatory detail.

**Generalization to Other Domains:** While our modular ontology design and bidirectional reasoning framework are domain-agnostic in principle, applying our approach to new manufacturing domains (e.g., semiconductor fabrication, injection molding, assembly systems) requires significant knowledge engineering. The fault taxonomy, diagnostic procedures, and component relationships must be re-authored for each domain. Transfer learning techniques for ontology construction and few-shot prompting for LLM adaptation show promise but require further research for reliable domain adaptation.

### 6.3 Generalizability

Despite these limitations, several aspects of our approach exhibit strong potential for generalization to related domains and applications.

**Architecture Template for Intelligent Manufacturing:** The four-layer architecture with explicit knowledge layer provides a reusable template for intelligent systems beyond fault diagnosis. The separation of concerns—perception (data collection), knowledge (semantic representation), reasoning (inference), and application (user interaction)—maps cleanly to applications requiring predictive maintenance, quality control, or production optimization. The modular interfaces and ontology-driven coordination mechanisms enable system evolution without architectural redesign. Other intelligent manufacturing applications requiring structured domain knowledge with natural language interfaces could adopt this architectural pattern.

**Knowledge Graph Construction Methodology:** Our modular ontology design process can transfer to other specialized domains requiring knowledge formalization. The process begins with identifying domain concepts, relationships, and constraints through engagement with domain experts. The modular design pattern—separating concerns into independent ontology modules with defined interfaces—enables distributed development where different experts can author separate modules simultaneously. The ALCHIQ description logic framework provides sufficient expressiveness for most technical domains while maintaining reasoning tractability.

**Bidirectional Reasoning Framework:** The neuro-symbolic integration approach with bidirectional knowledge flow applies beyond fault diagnosis to any application requiring both explainability and adaptability. The general pattern—knowledge validates neural outputs, neural extracts knowledge for knowledge base—can enhance purely symbolic systems (by adding natural language understanding) or purely neural systems (by adding factual grounding and explanation generation). Applications in medical diagnosis, legal reasoning, financial compliance, or technical support could benefit from this integration pattern.

**Multi-Modal Fusion for Robustness:** The three-level fusion architecture (data-level, feature-level, decision-level) is domain-agnostic and applicable wherever heterogeneous information sources must be integrated. Many industrial applications face similar challenges: combining real-time sensor streams, structured event logs, and unstructured documentation. Our fusion approach's emphasis on complementary sources—where the weaknesses of one modality are offset by strengths of another—provides a design principle applicable beyond fault diagnosis.

**Extension to Predictive Maintenance:** Our diagnostic framework naturally extends to predictive maintenance, where the goal is to anticipate failures before they occur. The knowledge graph can represent temporal fault patterns and degradation models, while the LLM can analyze emerging trends in sensor data and maintenance records to predict remaining useful life. The bidirectional mechanism enables continuous learning: predictions inform maintenance scheduling, and maintenance outcomes provide new training data that refines both the knowledge graph and the LLM's understanding of degradation patterns.

These generalization opportunities suggest that our contributions provide a foundation for broader impact in intelligent manufacturing and industrial AI. The modular design, formal theoretical framework, and empirical validation create a template for neuro-symbolic systems that can be adapted to diverse domains while maintaining the core benefits of explainability, accuracy, and continuous learning.
